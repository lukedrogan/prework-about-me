      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi, I'm Luke. I'm 30 years old and I work in the Digital Print industry. I've joined the Coding Bootcamp to develop new skills using coding to improve my business offering.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Manchester, England</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy watching & playing football, running, and reading.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I love the work I do in Digital Print, and look forward to applying new skills to my business </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Bamford, Greater Manchester.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've worked my whole adult life in an industry that relies heavily on new technology, yet I have worked in ignorance of the importance of coding & software development.
        I want to develop new skills and apply them to my print business and other future endeavours. I need to establish a solid presence online and feel that this course will help me to do this, whether developing the sites myself, or using knowledge from this course to better communicate my requirements to developers.
